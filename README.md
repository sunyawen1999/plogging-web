## Plogging Web App

## Overview

The Plogging Web App is designed to promote the eco-friendly activity of **plogging**, which combines **jogging with litter picking**. By engaging in plogging, users can contribute to a cleaner planet while staying active. This project aims to encourage more people to participate in this meaningful activity by making it easy and rewarding to track their efforts.

This is a front-end project for **uOttaHack7**. The back-end project is [here](https://github.com/NakyungIm/plogging.git).
